# Agent Workflows: Kanban → GitHub → Kimi → Review Gates

This repository participates in the shared OpenHax / Octave Commons automation stack. Agents working here should understand the following workflow before opening or reviewing PRs.

## GitHub event visibility

GitHub events are mirrored to Discord through `.github/workflows/github-events-discord.yml` using the `DISCORD_REVIEW_WEBHOOK_URL` secret.

Mirrored events include:

- issues and issue comments
- pull request lifecycle events
- pull request reviews
- releases
- pushes to `main`, `master`, `dev`, and `device/**`
- selected workflow completions for OpenCode/Kimi review workflows

Do not print or copy webhook URLs, bot tokens, GitHub tokens, Kimi keys, or other secrets into logs, issues, PR comments, or commits.

## Kimi issue agent

`.github/workflows/opencode-issue-agent.yml` runs OpenCode with Kimi For Coding on issue events and on a daily schedule.

Kimi may:

- triage new, reopened, or edited issues;
- ask for clarification when an issue is underspecified;
- close issues that are clearly irrelevant, spam, duplicates, or out of scope, with a concise reason;
- open a linked PR for a small safe fix.

Kimi must not close ambiguous issues or make broad/destructive changes.

## Kimi PR code review

`.github/workflows/opencode-code-review.yml` runs OpenCode with Kimi For Coding on pull requests.

Kimi should:

- review correctness, security, maintainability, tests, and repository conventions;
- submit concrete findings as GitHub PR inline review comments on exact changed lines whenever GitHub can attach them;
- leave a short passing summary when there are no actionable findings;
- treat linked Kanban/GitHub issues as the source of task intent.

Inline PR review comments are mirrored to Discord by `.github/workflows/code-review-comments-discord.yml`.

## CodeRabbit and review gates

CodeRabbit may add inline review comments. Repositories with branch protection enabled require review-thread resolution before merge when GitHub permits `required_conversation_resolution`.

Agent rules:

1. Do not merge while actionable inline review threads remain unresolved.
2. Resolve CodeRabbit/Kimi comments by patching the code or explicitly explaining why no change is needed.
3. Prefer small targeted commits over broad rewrites.
4. Re-run or wait for required checks after pushing fixes.

## Kanban → GitHub issue sync

Markdown Kanban cards are the local planning source. GitHub issues are the collaboration and automation surface.

The eta-mu CLI supports syncing Kanban cards to GitHub issues:

```bash
eta-mu kanban sync github --tasks-dir <kanban-dir> --repo <owner/repo> --dry-run
eta-mu kanban sync github --tasks-dir <kanban-dir> --repo <owner/repo> --max-writes 25 --write-delay-ms 5000
```

The underlying package command is also available:

```bash
openhax-kanban sync github --tasks-dir <kanban-dir> --repo <owner/repo>
```

Sync behavior:

- Issues are keyed by an idempotent marker: `<!-- openhax-kanban-sync uuid="..." -->`.
- Labels include `kanban`, `status:<status>`, `priority:<priority>`, and task frontmatter labels.
- Existing issues are updated when the Kanban title/body/status/labels change.
- Existing issues are closed when the task becomes `done` or `rejected`.
- New issues are not created for tasks already marked `done` or `rejected`.

GitHub enforces secondary content-creation limits. Always dry-run first and use `--max-writes` plus `--write-delay-ms` for live syncs.

## Kanban label vocabulary

Typical labels produced by sync:

- `kanban`
- `status:icebox`, `status:incoming`, `status:accepted`, `status:breakdown`, `status:blocked`, `status:ready`, `status:todo`, `status:in_progress`, `status:review`, `status:document`, `status:done`, `status:rejected`
- `priority:P0`, `priority:P1`, `priority:P2`, `priority:P3`
- task-specific frontmatter labels, normalized for GitHub

## Agent expectations

When working on this repo:

1. Look for local Kanban cards before creating new issues.
2. If an issue has an `openhax-kanban-sync` marker, treat the synced Kanban card as the source of truth.
3. Keep status labels consistent with actual task progress.
4. Mention or link the synced issue/PR relationship when opening fixes.
5. Preserve auditability: receipts, PR descriptions, and comments should explain what changed and why.
