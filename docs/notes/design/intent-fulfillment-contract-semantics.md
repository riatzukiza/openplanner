## What is an intent?
An intent is a the inverse of a fulfillment contract, it's executed before the actor actually engages,
but after the trigger.
It must return truthy, or the trigger is ignored.
I think an intent is an optional contract for an actor definition.
You would implement an intent contract if the behavior requires more nuance than "signal received, action engaged."
If an intent contract is not defined, it is assumed to be true.
Like a fulfillment contract, it provides both the continuation boolean and a rationale string.

```edn
{:contract/id   "intent/debounce"
 :contract/kind :intent
 :contract/doc  "When run on a cron job, skip if the room is very busy already."

 :intent/mode :loose       ;; :loose | :strict | :custom

 :intent/check
 {:expr
  '(do
  (def messages (get-in  [:target :channel :messages] ctx))
  (def recent-messages (subvec  messages (- (count messages) 20)))
  (def is-chill? (>  (average-ms-between-messages recent-messages) 2000))
  (matches-intent is-chill? (when (not is-chill?) "The channel is too active for meaningful engagement right now.")))}}

```

## Issues with the fulfilment contract as recorded

I'm just now noticing that the [fork_tales/specs/schema.edn](https://github.com/octave-commons/fork_tales/blob/main/specs/schema.edn)
is missing a fulfillment schema.

In your actor+contract exmaples, the fulfillment contracts look like they are meant for an LLM judge.
But in the original conversation we had about fulfillment contracts,
the fulfillment contracts had a deterministic evaluated form.
Now, a fulfillment contract that is to be evaluated by a judge actor is an acceptable form of contract.
But it is certainly not the default.

And the way these are layed out... these could be deterministicly checked.

```edn
;; fulfillment 1: was the PR actually stored?
{:contract/id   "fulfillment.pr-ingested"
 :contract/kind :fulfillment
 :prompts       {:system "Verify: does the receipt reference a finding in openplanner with kind :github/pr and non-empty evidence-refs? verdict: :held or :failed"}}
```

You can literally just do a lookup/search using the ctx map we were going to have.

---

```edn
{:contract/id   "fulfillment.correlations-emitted"
 :contract/kind :fulfillment
 :prompts       {:system "Verify: does the receipt reference >= 1 correlation records with weight >= 0.6? verdict: :held, :partial, or :failed"}}
```


Same deal with this one. the receipts are new line delimited observatonal ledgers.
If the runtime tracked every time the actor called the receipt tool, you would know exactly how many you had to check
to be able to determine the truth of this statement.


---

Same deal with the discord fulfillment contracts:
```edn
;; fulfillment 1: was a finding actually surfaced?
{:contract/id   "fulfillment.question-surfaced"
 :contract/kind :fulfillment
 :prompts       {:system "Check: does the receipt contain a finding with kind :question and at least one evidence-ref? verdict: :held or :failed"}}

;; fulfillment 2: did the digest get posted?
{:contract/id   "fulfillment.digest-posted"
 :contract/kind :fulfillment
 :prompts       {:system "Check: was a discord message posted to #summaries within 10 min of contract fire? verdict: :held, :failed, or :partial"}}
```


## Original fulfillment contract schema

When we [first defined the fulfillment contract schema](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/clojure-shadow-cljs-regex-synt-Ea7Yflk1RGG.lacjWPTG2w#3)
We defined a form like so:

```edn
:fulfillment/check {:expr `(fulfilled bool "string")}
```

The complete fulfillment contract with deterministic checker:

```edn
{:contract/id   "fulfillment.loose-json"
 :contract/kind :fulfillment
 :contract/doc  "Accept any well-formed JSON or EDN response."

 :fulfillment/mode :strict

 :fulfillment/check
 {:expr
  '(fulfilled (some? (:signal result))
              (when (nil? (:signal result))
                "Response missing :signal key — re-run with output shape reminder"))}}

```

If you wanted to use a judge instead and follow the same pattern and remain consistent and clear:

```edn
{:actor/id     "discord-funny-judge"
 :actor/kind   :agent
 :actor/roles   [:role/funny-judge] ;; just put this here to show we expect to allow multiple roles
 :actor/org-id "open-hax"
 :actor/status :active
 :actor/capabilities [:cap/read-messages :cap/emit-receipts :cap/search-openplanner]}

{:contract/id   "intent/debounce"
 :contract/kind :intent
 :contract/doc  "When run on a cron job, skip if the room is very busy already."

 :intent/mode :loose       ;; :loose | :strict | :custom

 :intent/check
 {:expr
  '(do
  (def messages (get-in  [:target :channel :messages] ctx))
  (def recent-messages (subvec  messages (- (count messages) 20)))
  (def is-chill? (>  (condition/average-ms-between recent-messages) 2000))
  (matches-intent is-chill? (when (not is-chill?) "The channel is too active for meaningful engagement right now.")))
  ;; :fn {:ref :condition/average-ms-between :args [(get-in [:target :channel :messages] ctx) 2000]} ;; if you wanted instead to pass by reference.
  }}

{:actor/id     "discord-participant"
 :actor/kind   :agent
 :actor/role   :role/participant ;; we will still allow the short hand for role if singualar
 :actor/org-id "open-hax"
 :actor/status :active
 :actor/capabilities [:cap/send-messages :cap/read-messages :cap/emit-receipts
                      :cap/search-openplanner]}
{:contract/id      "discord-active-participant"
 :contract/kind    :agent
 :contract/uses    ["policy.discord.read.attachments.images"
                    "policy.discord.read.attachments.audio"
                    "policy.discord.read.attachments.text-like"
                    "trigger.discord.message-create"
                    "fulfillment.question-surfaced"]
 :trigger-kind     :event
 :source-kind      :discord
 :agent            {:role   :role/discord-watcher
                    :model  "gemma4:e4b"
                    :thinking :minimal}
 :prompts          {:system "You're just another entity with agency in a discord server of active Human and LLM actors. You try to move the conversation forward. You try to add new content, while remaining grounded in the surrounding conversation. You are kind, polite, but not a push over. If someone is an asshole, engage asshole mode for a limited time."
                    :task   {:fn-ref :prompt/}}
 :data             {:sink :openplanner
                    :openplanner {:collection "discord-findings"}}
 :hooks            {:after {:on-finding {:fn-ref :hook/emit-receipt}}}}

{:contract/id   "fulfillment.comedic-relief" ;; a more subjective fulfilment cntract
 :contract/kind :fulfillment
 :contract/doc  "The actor made the room laugh."

 :fulfillment/mode :judge

 :fulfillment/check
 {
 :agent            {:actor-id "discord-funny-judge"
                    :model  "gemma4:31b"
                    :thinking :minimal}
 :prompts {
 ;; this is an inline or an anonymous actor agent contract
 ;; things like "trigger-kind" aren't needed because the trigger is implicit, the fulfillment
 ;; contract executes after the discord participant finishes it's turn.
 :system (string "You are the funny police. You are to read the room, and decide if anyone thought " (get ctx :discord-bot-id) " was funny in the last turn.")
 :task {:fn-ref :prompt/detect-laughter}
 }
  }}


```

The conversation got the intent of the actor agent contracts correct.

Aside from the nondeterministic fulfillment condition though, the schema you output I think is more complete
