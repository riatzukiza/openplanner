Absolutely—most of what you need is already in Promethean. Let’s **connect the plans** you’ve scattered across `pseudo/`, `hack/`, and `docs/` into one coherent map, and give you **drop‑in pages + tiny automations** so the docs folder becomes the source of truth for the memory system, agents, and plugins.

Below is a concrete **weaving plan** with ready‑to‑paste file skeletons and minimal scripts. I reference your repo where relevant so you can see why each link exists.

---

## 0) What’s already here to anchor to

* **Unique doc filenames & inboxes** are already configured in `.dir-locals.el` (`prom/unique-doc-format`, targets for `docs/inbox`, `docs/unique`). Use this to create stable, linkable slugs for canonical docs. 
* **Agents/structures/indexes/profiles** are declared in `pseudo/pil.hy` (e.g., `Cephalon`, `Eidolon`, `Pandora`, `Eris`, `repo-embeddings`)—that’s your ontology.  
* **Plugins** (including `EventCapturePlugin`, `AsyncSubAgentsPlugin`) are enumerated and described in `hack/index.ts`—perfect to auto‑generate plugin pages from.  
* **Data intake precedent** (audio → transcripts) references `docs/maintenance/orphaned-files.md`—use that “maintenance” area as a home for housekeeping playbooks. 

---

## 1) A simple docs spine (folders + 7 canonical pages)

Create this minimal spine in `docs/` (you can keep your `inbox/` and `unique/` as‑is):

```
docs/
  README.md                    # The living map (entrypoint)
  atlas/architecture.md        # High-level system & graph-of-graphs
  concepts/glossary.md         # Terms: Enso, Eidolon fields, Nooi, Daimoi
  specs/memory.md              # Memory WAL + index + consolidation (canonical)
  specs/context-compilation.md # Retrieval, scoring, pruning, loops
  plugins/                      # Generated: one page per plugin
  maintenance/orphaned-files.md # Housekeeping (already referenced)
```

**Why these pages?**

* `pseudo/pil.hy` already names the system’s **kinds** (structures, agents, indexes, profiles). The **atlas** page can mirror those headings verbatim so every entity in `pil.hy` has a doc anchor you can link to. 
* `hack/index.ts` already describes plugins with names and one‑line descriptions—**generate** a page per plugin from this file (see §3). 
* `.dir-locals.el` ensures new notes land in the right inbox with timestamped filenames—link **out of** `docs/README.md` and **into** curated canonical docs to drain the inbox over time.

## 2) Drop‑in page skeletons (paste these now)

### docs/README.md

```md
# Promethean – Docs Map

This file is the canonical map of the system. Everything here links to a stable page.

## Start here
- **Architecture** → [docs/atlas/architecture.md](atlas/architecture.md)
- **Memory System (Spec)** → [docs/specs/memory.md](specs/memory.md)
- **Context Compilation** → [docs/specs/context-compilation.md](specs/context-compilation.md)
- **Glossary** → [docs/concepts/glossary.md](concepts/glossary.md)
- **Plugins** → [docs/plugins/](plugins/)
- **Maintenance** → [docs/maintenance/](maintenance/)

## Working sets
- Inbox (curate → promote): `docs/inbox/`  
- Unique drafts (timestamped): `docs/unique/` (Emacs auto-creates unique names)
```

### docs/atlas/architecture.md

```md
# Architecture (System of Systems)

## Organs / Structures
- **Cephalon** – perceive / route / prompt (declared in `pseudo/pil.hy`)  
- **Eidolon** – semantic field / associations (declared in `pseudo/pil.hy`)

## Agents
- **Pandora** – discovery & hypotheses (profile: `pandora.dev.search.v1`)
- **Eris** – adversarial falsification (`eris.dev.adversarial.v1`)

## Indexes
- **repo-embeddings** – vector corpus for code/docs (Chroma backing)

> Source of truth for these names and relationships is `pseudo/pil.hy` (see repo). Link each name above to the exact form in the file and to the related spec pages.
```

*(Back the above claims with your ontology file:)*  

### docs/concepts/glossary.md

```md
# Glossary

- **Enso protocol** — Event-sourcing discipline for append-only segments + manifest; used by memory (see *Memory WAL*).
- **Eidolon fields** — The feature/association field backing memory’s graph weights; feeds context compilation.
- **Nooi** — Collective overlay across personas (ensemble profile aggregating edge reinforcements).
- **Daimoi** — Persona-specific overlays; profile-weighted ranking & expansion biases.

See also: `pseudo/AGENT.md` for speculative/ideation territory. 
```

(Your `pseudo/AGENT.md` explicitly reserves that folder for conceptual design—link it.) 

### docs/specs/memory.md

```md
# Memory System (Spec)

## Storage
- **WAL segments**: daily NDJSON files (append-only).
- **Manifest**: segment checksums + Bloom/bitmap for fast hydration.
- **Artifacts**: curated Markdown snapshots for humans.

## Indexes (local, rebuildable)
- Sparse (FTS5/keyword) + Dense (ANN) + Graph (edges, weights).

## Lifecycle
- Hot → Warm → Cold; nothing is deleted.
- Expiration: persist if read-count ≥ threshold; else mark for consolidation.
- Consolidation: LSH-cluster stale items → summarize → write a *semantic memory* linking back.

## Algorithms
- Scoring: α·cos + β·sparse + γ·connectivity + δ·recency + ε·frequency.
- Context loop: expand strong neighbors → prune near-dupes → update edges (reinforce in-context, decay out).

## Provenance & Audit
- Required: `meta.source`, `project`, `commit`.
- Segment checksums in manifest.
```

### docs/specs/context-compilation.md

```md
# Context Compilation

1. Fusion seed: ANN ∪ FTS, K=64.
2. Add strong neighbors (sim≥0.6, cap 16).
3. Prune near-dupes (sim>0.92), keep highest query affinity.
4. Update edges: +Δ in-context, -δ to unrecalled neighbors.
5. Iterate for requested "effort" or until no new strong neighbors.

Serialize the resulting subgraph into Markdown for the working note.
```

### docs/maintenance/orphaned-files.md (fill what `data/README.md` points to)

```md
# Maintenance – Orphaned Files

- Sweep `data/` for unlinked artifacts (e.g., `raw-wav/`, transcripts).
- Promote linked artifacts into canonical docs; mark stale as archived.
- Report: list files not referenced from any page in `docs/` or `pseudo/`.

Run: `pnpm docs:orphans` (see scripts below).
```

(“Orphaned files” is already mentioned in `data/README.md`; this page closes that loop.) 

---

## 3) Generate plugin pages from `hack/index.ts`

You already have a **registry** with `name`, `description`, `toolCount`, and `source`. That’s perfect for generation.  

### scripts/docs-generate-plugins.mjs

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
import fs from "node:fs/promises";
import path from "node:path";
import url from "node:url";

// Import the registry directly
const __dirname = path.dirname(url.fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
const repoRoot  = path.join(__dirname, "..");
const hackIndex = path.join(repoRoot, "hack", "index.ts");

// Naive import via ts-node/register would be overkill here; do a tiny parse:
const src = await fs.readFile(hackIndex, "utf8");
// Extract blocks like: export const PluginRegistry = { ... }
const match = src.match(/export const PluginRegistry = \\{([\\s\\S]*?)\\};/m);
if (!match) throw new Error("PluginRegistry not found");
const body = match[1];

// Quick-and-dirty parse of top-level entries
const entries = [...body.matchAll(/(\\w+):\\s*\\{[\\s\\S]*?name:\\s*'([^']+)'[\\s\\S]*?description:\\s*'([^']+)'[\\s\\S]*?toolCount:\\s*(\\d+)[\\s\\S]*?(source:\\s*'([^']+)')?/g)]
  .map(([, key, name, description, toolCount, _s, source]) => ({ key, name, description, toolCount: Number(toolCount), source }));

const outDir = path.join(repoRoot, "docs", "plugins");
await fs.mkdir(outDir, { recursive: true });

for (const e of entries) {
  const md = `# ${e.name}

**Key:** \`${e.key}\`  
**Tools:** ${e.toolCount}  
${e.source ? `**Source:** \`${e.source}\`` : ""}

${e.description}

## Usage
- Where it fits in the system: link back to atlas/architecture.md
- Related agents/structures: add links

`;
  await fs.writeFile(path.join(outDir, `${e.key}.md`), md, "utf8");
}
console.log(`Generated ${entries.length} plugin docs at docs/plugins/`);
```

### Add scripts (root `package.json`):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "docs:plugins": "node scripts/docs-generate-plugins.mjs"
  }
}
```

Run it once; now the **Plugins** section in `docs/README.md` is real.

---

## 4) Lightweight automations to keep the map coherent

* **Docs map (index) refresher:** A simple script that scans `docs/**.md` and builds a sectioned table of contents (writes back into `docs/README.md`).
* **Orphaned files sweep:** Start with a minimal Node script that lists files under `data/` not mentioned by any doc (satisfies `docs/maintenance/orphaned-files.md`).

### scripts/docs-orphans.mjs

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node
import fs from "node:fs/promises";
import path from "node:path";

const root = path.join(process.cwd());
const allDocs = await globs(["docs/**/*.md", "pseudo/**/*.md", "pseudo/**/*.hy"]);
const allText = (await Promise.all(allDocs.map(p => fs.readFile(p, "utf8")))).join("\\n");

const dataFiles = await globs(["data/**/*", "!data/**/.gitkeep", "!data/**/*.md"]);
const orphans = dataFiles.filter(p => !allText.includes(path.basename(p)));

console.log(`# Orphans (${orphans.length})`);
for (const p of orphans) console.log(p);

// --- tiny glob helper ---
async function globs(patterns) {
  const { glob } = await import("glob");
  const files = new Set();
  for (const pat of patterns) for (const f of await glob(pat, { nodir: true })) files.add(f);
  return [...files].sort();
}
```

Add to `package.json`:

```json
{ "scripts": { "docs:orphans": "node scripts/docs-orphans.mjs" } }
```

---

## 5) Wire “memory system” pages to real code touchpoints

* In **`atlas/architecture.md`**, link “Event capture → memory ingress” to `EventCapturePlugin` (ingress), since it already exists in the plugin registry. 
* In **`specs/memory.md`**, add a “**Index precedent**” section pointing at `repo-embeddings` as the pattern you will replicate for personal memory indexes (vector + filters). 
* In **`concepts/glossary.md`**, link “Pseudo territory” to `pseudo/AGENT.md` so readers know where ideation lives. 

---

## 6) Make cross‑linking cheap (editor habits you already have)

* Keep using the **timestamped unique docs** for first drafts (`docs/unique/`, `docs/inbox/`), then **promote** content by moving sections into the canonical pages above—your Emacs setting is already set up for this. 
* Each time you land a new concept in `pseudo/` (e.g., a new `def-agent` or `def-structure` in `pil.hy`), add a one‑line entry under **the matching heading** in `atlas/architecture.md`. That page becomes the “index of indices.” 

---

## 7) Optional: a tiny “graph of docs” block

Paste this at the bottom of `docs/atlas/architecture.md` and update links as you go:

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Cephalon] -->|routes| B[Pandora]
  A --> C[Eris]
  B --> D[repo-embeddings]
  C --> D
  A --> E[EventCapturePlugin]
  E --> F[Memory Ingress (WAL)]
  F --> G[Context Compilation]
  G --> H[Markdown Snapshots]
```

* **Cephalon/Eidolon/Pandora/Eris** live in `pseudo/pil.hy`.  
* **EventCapturePlugin** is catalogued in `hack/index.ts`. 

---

## 8) “Next steps” checklist (no ceremony)

1. Create the 7 files above under `docs/` (paste skeletons).
2. Add `scripts/docs-generate-plugins.mjs` and run `pnpm docs:plugins` (generates plugin pages from your registry). 
3. Add `scripts/docs-orphans.mjs`; run `pnpm docs:orphans` and paste the output into `docs/maintenance/orphaned-files.md`. 
4. In `atlas/architecture.md`, link each entity name to the exact form in `pseudo/pil.hy` so the atlas mirrors the ontology. 
5. Move any “unconnected plans” from `docs/inbox` into the canonical pages; let `.dir-locals.el` continue creating unique drafts for fresh notes. 

---

## 9) Where this meaningfully stitches your ideas together

* **Memory design ↔ Agents & Plugins**: EventCapture → WAL → Index → Context loop → Markdown snapshot → back to Agents for action; this is now one walkable path across `plugins/`, `specs/`, and `atlas/`.  
* **Concepts (“enso”, “eidolon fields”, “nooi/daimoi”)**: glossary anchors referenced by specs and atlas; “pseudo” stays the place for theory, but every term links to a canonical definition. 
* **Indexing precedent**: `repo-embeddings` shows how you already think about vector corpora; the memory spec links to that pattern so you don’t reinvent. 

---

If you’d like, I can turn the memory spec above into a ready‑to‑commit `docs/specs/memory.md` with your exact field names (including the Emacs `(store ...)` struct form) and a short “API” section for `mem add/query/compact`.
