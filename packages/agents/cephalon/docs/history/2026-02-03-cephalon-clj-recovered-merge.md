# cephalon-clj recovered merge (2026-02-03)

## Goal
- Merge any recovered cephalon-clj work into `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-clj`.
- Fix dependency resolution failures preventing `clj -M:run`.

## Requirements
- Prefer recovered content when it is more complete than existing files.
- Do not drop existing functionality in `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-clj`.
- Keep changes minimal and aligned with current code style.

## Sessions referenced
- `ses_3f5339c24ffe6TGia1UjGRBEjX`
- `ses_3db3fc8ecffe61Fe7E7B6kH9v3`
- `ses_3df579644ffeNG2tjrdm0p58fw`
- `ses_3e342c391fferP33D3u4iN83pY`

## Files and paths
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-clj/deps.edn`
- `recovered/cephalon-clj/paths.txt`
- `recovered/cephalon-clj/paths-in-history.txt`

## Investigation notes
- `recovered/cephalon-clj` contains only directories and log folders; no `.clj/.cljc/.cljs/.edn/.json/.md` sources were present.
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-clj` contains the active CLJ sources listed by the user.

## Implementation plan
### Phase 1: Inventory + compare
- Confirm recovered sources exist (none found).
- Identify any recovered files to merge (none found).

### Phase 2: Fix dependency resolution
- Update JDA dependency to a resolvable version.

### Phase 3: Verify runtime
- Attempt `clj -M:run` and capture the result.

## Definition of done
- [x] Recovered source inventory completed.
- [x] Any recovered content merged into `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-clj`.
- [x] Dependency resolution fixed (JDA).
- [x] Runtime check after dependency change completes.

## Change log
- Updated JDA dependency in `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-clj/deps.edn` to `6.3.0`.
- Fixed executor submit ambiguity in `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-clj/src/promethean/adapters/fs_watch.clj` by adding a `^Runnable` hint.
- Ensured `docs/notes` directory is created before watcher starts in `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-clj/src/promethean/main.clj`.
- Verified `clj -M:run` starts (bounded by `timeout 10s`).

## Verification
- `timeout 10s clj -M:run` in `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-clj` starts successfully and prints startup banner.
- `lsp_diagnostics` failed to initialize (marksman server error); no LSP output available for modified files.
