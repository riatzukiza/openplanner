# Cephalon TS Merge (services -> packages)

## Context
- Merge `services/cephalon-ts` into `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts` with services as the preferred source of truth.
- Preserve any packages-only content if it is not present in services (notably bot config).

## Requirements
- Sync all tracked source/config files from `services/cephalon-ts` into `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts`.
- Preserve packages-only file `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/src/config/bots.ts` unless a services equivalent exists.
- Do not copy generated artifacts: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `logs/`, `test-results/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`.
- Keep package metadata consistent with services version.

## Plan
Phase 1: Diff trees, identify unique files and conflicts.
Phase 2: Sync services -> packages and re-verify that only packages-only files remain.
Phase 3: Run diagnostics/tests and record results.

## Files (targets + references)
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/package.json:1`
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/src/app.ts:1`
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/src/cli.ts:1`
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/src/index.ts:1`
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/src/main.ts:1`
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/src/llm/ollama.ts:1`
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/src/ui/server.ts:1`
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/src/config/bots.ts:1`
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/playwright.config.ts:1`
- `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/src/llm/tools/executor.ts:1`

## Existing Issues / PRs
- None referenced.

## Definition of Done
- Diff between `services/cephalon-ts` and `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts` is empty except for `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts/src/config/bots.ts` and excluded generated artifacts.
- Diagnostics clean on edited files.
- Package tests pass (or failures documented if pre-existing).

## Changelog
- 2026-02-03: Synced `services/cephalon-ts` into `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts` (excluded generated artifacts). Preserved packages-only `src/config/bots.ts`.
- 2026-02-03: `pnpm build` succeeded with tsup warnings about `import.meta` in CJS output (`src/ui/server.ts`).
- 2026-02-03: `pnpm test` failed due to ESM imports of `*.js` from TS sources (e.g. `src/app.test.ts`, `src/index.test.ts`, `src/chroma/client.test.ts`, `src/llm/tools/executor.ts`).
- 2026-02-03: Switched cephalon-ts tests to compile via `tsconfig.test.json`, updated AVA to run `build/**/*.test.js`, and hardened UI server + tests to avoid env races.
- 2026-02-03: `pnpm test` passed in `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts` (54 tests).
- 2026-02-03: Removed `services/cephalon-ts` after completing merge to prevent agent confusion; `orgs/octave-commons/cephalon/packages/cephalon-ts` remains canonical.
