  "Code-level registry for event drivers.

   Drivers are not resources. A driver is ClojureScript code that knows how to
   normalize events from one system (Discord, sessions, translations, etc.) and
   dispatch them into the event runtime. Source resources declare which driver
   implementation they use, which actor owns credentials, and which driver event
   types they care about."
