  "Store registry: resolve store resource definitions into IStore instances.

   Stores are declared by resources (:store/id + :store/schema) and requested
   by actions through :action/scope {:stores [...]}. Instances are cached by
   qualified id. Explicit registration wins — that is how database-backed
   stores (e.g. MongoCollection with an injected handle) replace the default
   memory backend.

   Dependencies are injected via the :contract-runtime/deps key in config:
   - :load-resources (fn [config] -> [{:resource/kind :resource/definition} ...])"
