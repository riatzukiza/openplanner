  "Pure parsing for namespace resource files — the resource manifest grammar.

   A namespace file groups resources under one :namespace:

     {:namespace :ussyverse :resources [{...} ...]}

   The grammar (see docs/design/resource-architecture.md):

   - REGISTRATION — `:K/id` registers a resource of kind K. Identity is the
     namespace plus the local id: :namespace :ussyverse + :trigger/id
     :social-replies -> :ussyverse/social-replies. Every kind can be
     registered this way; no kind has to be.

   - COMPOSITE — one entry may register several kinds at once (trigger +
     action + store ...). Each interpreter reads only the keys in its own
     namespace (`:trigger/*`, `:action/*`, `:store/*`, ...).

   - ANONYMOUS FACETS (ownership) — `:K/<field>` keys without `:K/id` declare
     an anonymous resource of kind K, owned by whatever kinds the entry does
     register. Anonymous facets are never registered and never discoverable;
     they are read in place by kind K's interpreter (`:action/fn` on a trigger
     is the canonical example).

   - REFERENCES — references to other resources live under the OWNING kind's
     namespace (`:trigger/action`, `:role/capabilities`, `:model/family`).
     A bare `:K/id` always means identity, never a reference."
